# Version-Control

**Version Control System (VCS) Notes**:

1. **Purpose**:
   - Tracks changes to files over time for recall of specific versions later.
   - Facilitates collaboration among programmers and developers.

2. **Components**:
   - Collection of software tools designed to manage changes in source code.
   - Utilizes a specialized database to keep track of modifications to code.

3. **Working of Git**:
   - Git captures changes by creating snapshots of file states at different points in time.
   - Each snapshot represents a version, forming a historical record of the codebase.
   - Projects are organized into repositories, containing all files, history, and metadata.
   
4. **Key Features**:
   - **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on the same project concurrently, contributing changes independently.
   - **Branches**: Developers can create separate branches to work on features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.
   - **Merging**: Git provides tools to merge changes from different branches, integrating them into a single branch.
   - **Conflict Resolution**: When conflicting changes occur, Git assists in resolving conflicts by highlighting differences and enabling developers to choose which changes to keep.

5. **Distributed Nature**:
   - Git is a distributed VCS, meaning each developer maintains a complete copy of the repository, including its entire history.
   - Developers can work offline and collaborate effectively even without a central server.

6. **Importance**:
   - Essential tool for modern software development, ensuring efficient management of code changes and collaboration among team members.
   - Enables developers to maintain a detailed history of the codebase, facilitating debugging, auditing, and project management.

### Git Version Control 
**A version control system is a software that tracks changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It also allows you to work together with other programmers or developers.**

- The version control system is a collection of software tools that help a team to manage changes in a source code. It uses a special kind of database to keep track of every modification to the code
